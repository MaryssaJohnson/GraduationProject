# GraduationProject

## Overview
Made to celebrate a graduation milestone in a creative way while building and practicing web development skills like layout, animation, and user interaction. When the user clicks the “Associate of Science in Computer Science” button, an animated avatar walks across the screen under a spotlight. As the avatar moves, confetti and sparkles fall, music and cheering play, and a “Congratulations” banner appears. There's also a second button labeled “Bachelor of Science in Computer Science,” which leads to a “Coming Soon” page.  
Both pages include a “Back to Main Page” button for easy navigation.
